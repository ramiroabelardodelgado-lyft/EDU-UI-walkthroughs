# Figma Script Documentation

## Overview

This script utilizes EDU UI Figma components to drive UI walkthrough animations in After Effects. It allows designers to create seamless and interactive UI animations by leveraging pre-built components.

## How It Works

1. **Place EDU UI Components**:
   - Use the EDU UI Figma components and place them over the UI screen you are working on.
   - Ensure that these components are placed in the highest hierarchy possible within a container Frame, as shown in the image below.

   ![Hierarchy Example](./img/hierarchy.png)

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - In the current version (0.17), the names of the EDU components should NOT be modified. The script relies on these names to determine which animation is being used.

## Installation Process

1. **Download the Plugin**:
   - Download / Clone the GitHub repository.
2. **Copy Files**:
   - Copy the contents of the downloaded zip to a location that is not your downloads folder. If you delete these files after installing through the Development menu, it will break the plugin.

3. **Import Plugin**:
   - Right-click the canvas and navigate to `Plugins > Development > Import plugin from manifest...`.
    ![import](./img/import.png)

   - Navigate to the folder you created in step 2, and select the `manifest.json` file.
    ![manifest](./img/manifest.png)


4. **Access the Plugin**:
   - The panel will close and the UI walkthrough will now be available by:
     - Pressing `CMD+/` or `Ctrl+/` to open the Quick Actions menu and start typing 'edu-ui-walkthroughs', or
     - Right-clicking and navigating to `Plugins > Development > edu-ui-walkthrough`.
        ![menu](./img/menu.png)



## How to Run the Plugin

1. **Select Frames**:
   - Before running the Figma script, select the Frames you want to export.

2. **Open Plugin Menu**:
   - Press the `âŒ˜` (cmd) and `,` (comma) keys to open the plugin menu.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Type `edu-ui-walkthrough` and press Enter.
   - The script will rename the selected Frames (in Left to Right order) as 01, 02, 03, etc.
     - *Note*: The order of selection doesn't matter; it uses the Frame's global x position on the canvas for the order.

4. **Save Exported Files**:
   - The script will prompt you to save a zip file. This file contains PNG exports of your frames and a JSON file necessary for the AE-walkthrough plugin.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Setup**:
   - Open your Figma project and navigate to the UI screen you want to animate.
   - Drag and drop the EDU UI components onto your screen.

2. **Hierarchy**:
   - Ensure that the components are placed at the highest hierarchy within a container Frame. This is crucial for the script to function correctly.

3. **Naming**:
   - Do not change the names of the EDU components. The script uses these names to identify and apply the correct animations.

## Example Use Cases

- Creating interactive UI walkthroughs for onboarding new users.
- Demonstrating new features or updates in a UI.
- Enhancing presentations with animated UI elements.

## Prerequisites

- Figma account with access to the EDU UI components.
- After Effects for rendering the animations.

## Dependencies

- EDU UI Figma components library.


README

This Figma plugin uses EDU-UI components to quickly mockup ui walkthroughs, this plugin exports
a zip file containing pngs and a json file.
The pngs are from selected frames or frames under a selected Figma "Section" using a 1290x2796 image resolution settings setting. 
The json contains each of the EDU-UI Components position, size and name, as well as the original Frame size.
The zip file should be unzipped in order to be read by the AE_Walkthroughs.jsx after effects script.
